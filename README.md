# burger_app
A simple app designed to demonstrate MVC fundamentals and the use of Sequelize.

# Description

![alt text](./public/assets/gif/burger_app.gif "Title")

This application allows users to input the names of burgers that they would like to eat and move burgers from one list to another based on whether that burger has been consumed. 

When a user types in a burger name and clicks "Submit," the burger will then be displayed on the left side of the page, underneath the "Uneaten Burgers" list with an "Eat!" button. When the user clicks the "Eat!" button for that particular burger, that burger will be moved to the right side of the page, underneath the "Devoured Burgers" list. Each burger that the user inputs is stored in the database.
